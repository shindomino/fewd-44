                <p>After suffering three defeats in a row from Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus is separated from his tentacle pack. After his tentacle pack breaks free and helps Doctor Octopus get out of prison, he contacts every known supervillain that had crossed paths with Spider-Man. Only Vulture, Electro, Kraven the Hunter, the original Mysterio, and Sandman respond. As none of the members are willing to relinquish the honor of killing Spider-Man themselves, they decide to challenge Spider-Man individually with the order in which they face him determined by random drawing. The Sinister Six kidnap Daily Bugle secretary Betty Brant and Aunt May, holding them hostage in order to force Spider-Man to confront them. Spider-Man defeats the Sinister Six one-by-one, mocking their decision to battle him individually instead of as a team.</p>

                <p>In The Amazing Spider-Man #334-339, Doctor Octopus recruits Electro, Mysterio, Sandman, and Vulture, along with the demonic Hobgoblin (since Kraven the Hunter had died) as part of his plan to take over the world. However, this was a trick, part of a larger plan by which Octavius alone would be the master of the world. The Sandman, who at this point in his career had reformed and was blackmailed into joining, aids Spider-Man in defeating the Sinister Six, and ultimately stopping Octavius' plans to conquer the world.</p><br>
