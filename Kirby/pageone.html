				<p>I am from Atlanta, Georgia. Born in 1991 at Grady Memorial Hospital. I am the oldest of 5 siblings, with one that strikingly similiar to me in terms of likes and dislikes with some slight alterations. I was in both the ARMY ROTC as well as marching band throughout high school and majority of college. I was in the United States Army as a 42A (human resources), and majority of my jobs up to now focused on sales and customer service.</p>

				<p>Ever since I was a child, I always found myself in front of a keyboard, fascinated by it's design and technology. As I grew older, I started collecting Marvel comic books, and found myself attempting to replicate the art style, hence me becoming an artist. Over time, I would hone my craft to a point where I enrolled in college to pursue my new love. However, the computer continued to call me back. So, I would combine the two elements of artistry and my love for technology. Which has led me to this new chapter of pursuing Front-End Development. I am hoping to be accepted into a school that will teach me everything I need to know and grant me the challenge of creating the ultimate web-page.</p>

				<p>This webpage in it's Alpha format. It was fun learning how to create a page, and I will continue to alter this page and make it better. My goal is to have a working page complete with both CSS and Javascript elements within the next 6 months.</p>
